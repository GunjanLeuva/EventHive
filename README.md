# EventHive
EventHive is an academic-level event management platform designed and developed by our team using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. The platform is divided into two main modules: the Admin module and the User module.

--> The Admin module allows administrators to efficiently manage key event components such as:

Categories and Subcategories: Organize and categorize various types of events.
Catering and Decoration Services: Manage food options, decorations, and photography arrangements.
Invitation and Entertainment: Handle invitation designs and entertainment services.
Hotel and Food Arrangements: Oversee venue selection and dining arrangements for events.

--> The User module provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can:

Browse and Select Events: Explore and choose from a wide range of event types and packages.
Book Events and Make Payments: Securely book and pay for selected events through the platform.
View Event Details and Invitation Photos: Access event details, including customized invitation photos.
EventHive delivers a streamlined experience for both administrators and end-users, enhancing the overall event planning process. As an academic project, it demonstrates our team's technical expertise and ability to create practical, real-world solutions in event management.
